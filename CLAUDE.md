# Simple Runner

Cross-platform (Android-first, iOS later) running app in **Flutter**: live GPS metrics (speed, pace, splits), GPX track logging, eventually a customizable live display.

**Read [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) before doing any work** — it holds the phased plan, the verified machine environment, Windows-specific setup gotchas, and per-phase acceptance criteria.

## Current status

- **Phase 0 (MVP: live GPS speed on Android) — NOT STARTED.** Repo contains only planning docs; Flutter is not yet installed on this machine.
- Update this section as work progresses (phase started/done, deviations from PLAN.md).

## Quick facts (details in PLAN.md §1)

- Windows 11, PowerShell. Android SDK at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`; Android Studio at `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio` (use its `jbr` as the Gradle JDK — the Java 8 on PATH is too old).
- No AVDs exist yet; cmdline-tools not installed; Windows Developer Mode needed for Flutter plugin symlinks.
- Test on emulator (simulated GPX routes) for iteration, physical Android phone over USB for real GPS truth.

## Commands

```powershell
flutter doctor -v        # toolchain health (only Android section must be green)
flutter pub get
flutter analyze          # must be clean before finishing any task
flutter test             # must pass before finishing any task
flutter run              # runs on the connected device/emulator
```

## Architecture rules (from PLAN.md §3 — follow strictly)

- Feature-first layout: `lib/app`, `lib/core/{location,units,files}`, `lib/domain/{models,tracking}`, `lib/features/live_run`.
- `core/units` and `domain/` are **pure Dart** — no `flutter` imports; unit-test everything there.
- The app touches GPS only through the `LocationService` interface (`core/location`) and our own `LocationSample` model — geolocator types never leak out of `core/location/`.
- Metric tiles are driven by a `MetricSpec` list even while the layout is static — this is what makes the future customizable display cheap.
- State: Riverpod, one-way flow (service stream → Notifier → immutable state → widgets).

## Conventions

- Units displayed: km/h and min/km. All conversions/formatting via `core/units`, nowhere else.
- Speeds are stored internally in m/s (as GPS provides); convert only at display time.
- Commit at meaningful milestones; stay on `main` unless told otherwise.
